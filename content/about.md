My name is Joseph LeRoy and I'm an information security professional born and raised in New Jersey. I'm currently living in Tokyo, Japan. I volunteer my free time by helping out with a Tokyo-based technology community called [Dev Japan](https://www.devjapan.jp) and an Armed Forces technology non-profit called [AFCEA Tokyo (東京)](https://afceatokyo.org).

I was enlisted in the U.S. Navy and stationed in Yokosuka, Japan from 2008 - 2011. Shortly after completing my active duty obligation, I moved back to the United States and attended Fordham University where I earned a [Bachelor of Science in Computer Science](https://www.fordham.edu/info/25364/computer_science_degree) and a [Master of Science in Cybersecurity](https://www.fordham.edu/info/25706/master_of_science_in_cybersecurity).

I'm primarily interested in defensive security, network forensics, and systems engineering. I also enjoy attending technology conferences and playing real-time strategy games. 

I have a somewhat extensive library of technical resources related to Computer Science, Philosophy, and Information Technology, and float between genres by season.

Here's a list of books that I'm currently reading:
